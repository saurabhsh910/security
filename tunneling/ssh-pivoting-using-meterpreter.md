# SSH pivoting using Meterpreter

**Pivoting** is a technique to get inside an unreachable network with help of pivot \(center point\). In simple words, it is an attack through which an attacker can exploit that system which belongs to the different network. For this attack, the attacker needs to exploit the main server that helps the attacker to add himself inside its local network and then the attacker will able to target the client system for the attack.
